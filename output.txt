**Main Ideas**

1. The impostor phenomenon is a pervasive issue among neurology trainees in Singapore, peaking at the commencement of neurology residency.
2. A systematic review of existing literature on impostor phenomenon and its measurement scales revealed varying results across studies.
3. The current study used factor analysis to validate the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS) for measuring impostor phenomenon among neurology trainees in Singapore.
4. Results showed that the CIPS exhibited high levels of reliability and validity, with Cronbach's alpha = 0.93.
5. The study concludes that targeted interventions are needed to mitigate the impostor phenomenon among neurology trainees.
